    overview_description: TCI StreetFighter transmissions are durable enough to withstand
      the rigors of even the toughest street machines. Equipped with a manual/automatic
      valve body, most units allow you to manually shift the vehicle into each gear
      change or, by placing it in the drive position, remain fully automatic. In either
      mode, you get a race track shift that bangs through the gears and shaves time
      off of your ETs. When you use the manual gear selection feature, the StreetFighters
      upshift and downshift right when you move the lever, with no lag or governor override.
      When you select the normal drive position, they retain positive automatic shifts
      for the ease of driving you look for in an automatic transmission.

    overview_description: Summit® Extreme Performance cross-drilled and slotted brake
      rotors are manufactured on CNC machines using CAD-CAM design for perfect balance
      and alignment. These rotors provide you with maximum stopping power, reduced warping,
      and longer life. The cross-drilled holes and slots provide an exit route for gasses
      and dust, resulting in better heat dissipation and less brake fade under hard
      use. Other solid-surface rotors allow gasses to create a cushion between the pad
      and the brake rotor, resulting in poor brake performance. The cross-drilled  holes
      and slots clear away harmful gasses, restoring full pad-to-rotor contact. These
      rotors are a terrific performance upgrade when replacing your OE rotors.

    overview_description: MSD 8.5mm Super Conductor spark plug wire sets feature a
      special helically wound core that has just 40-50 ohms of resistance per foot—but
      with an RFI suppression equal to a 1,500 ohm wire. In fact, each foot of finished
      wire includes 40 ft. of tightly wound copper for superior conductivity. This winding
      procedure, combined with a ferro-magnetic impregnated center core, produces an
      extremely effective Electro Magnetic Interference "choke." This choke, or suppression
      capability, keeps the EMI inside the wire where it cannot interfere with other
      electronics on your vehicle. A tough, 8.5mm synthetic/silicone jacket over an
      extra-heavy glass braid and dielectric insulator keeps the current guided to the
      plugs. Underneath the high-temperature boots, dual crimp stainless steel terminals
      feature snap-locks to ensure a secure fit. Each set comes with clip-on cylinder
      markers for easy identification. MSD's 8.5mm Super Conductor wire sets are available
      in custom or universal-fit applications.

      and dust, resulting in better heat dissipation and less brake fade under hard

      and the brake rotor, resulting in poor brake performance. The cross-drilled  holes
      and slots clear away harmful gasses, restoring full pad-to-rotor contact. These
      rotors are a terrific performance upgrade when replacing your OE rotors.

      special helically wound core that has just 40-50 ohms of resistance per foot—but
      with an RFI suppression equal to a 1,500 ohm wire. In fact, each foot of finished
      wire includes 40 ft. of tightly wound copper for superior conductivity. This winding
      procedure, combined with a ferro-magnetic impregnated center core, produces an
      extremely effective Electro Magnetic Interference "choke." This choke, or suppression
      capability, keeps the EMI inside the wire where it cannot interfere with other
      electronics on your vehicle. A tough, 8.5mm synthetic/silicone jacket over an
      extra-heavy glass braid and dielectric insulator keeps the current guided to the
      plugs. Underneath the high-temperature boots, dual crimp stainless steel terminals
      feature snap-locks to ensure a secure fit. Each set comes with clip-on cylinder
      markers for easy identification. MSD's 8.5mm Super Conductor wire sets are available
